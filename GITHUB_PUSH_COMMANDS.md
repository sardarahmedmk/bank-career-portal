# ðŸš€ GitHub Deployment Commands

## After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

### Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\Sardar Ahmed\PycharmProjects\ubl_jd_chatbot"

# Add GitHub remote (REPLACE YOUR_USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ubl-bank-career-portal.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Example with actual username:
If your GitHub username is `sardaahmed`, then use:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/sardaahmed/ubl-bank-career-portal.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check remote is added correctly
git remote -v

# Check branch status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline
```

## If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. You might need to set up a Personal Access Token
3. Or use GitHub Desktop for easier authentication

1. âœ… Repository will be live on GitHub
2. âœ… Add screenshots using the SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md
3. âœ… Update README links with your actual username
4. âœ… Star your own repository!
